"""
elementor_snaps is a python script designed to take screenshots of Elementor pages.

The default class we will be taking screenshots from is the elementor-element class as that is usually the class that
contains one singular component.

Why?
---
This script was created to automate the process of taking screenshots of Elementor pages. This is useful for recreating
the UI of elementor websites using LLMs for other purposes.

The project only has one dependency, which is the playwright library.
